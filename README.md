vault write auth/google/role/default \
    bound_emails=eduardoagrj@gmail.com \
    policies=default
```

> Google Organizations with Google Groups Example:

You need to enable the [Admin SDK](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/authorizing) to be able to list the email groups

```shell
vault write auth/google/config \
    client_id=<GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID> \
    client_secret=<GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET> \
    fetch_groups=true
```

* Create a role for a Google group mapping to a set of policies:

```shell
vault write auth/google/role/default \
    bound_domain=<DOMAIN> \
    bound_groups=sec@<DOMAIN>,infra@<DOMAIN> \
    policies=default

firefox $(vault read -field=url auth/google/code_url)
vault write auth/google/login code=$GOOGLE_CODE role=default
